# Anxiety_Depression_Probabilities

In this repository, you will find all of the independent scripts that were used as well as the CSVs for both of the notebooks. You are more than welcome to download the notebook if you want to test out the functions! However please be informed that you must also download the independent Python scripts that are found in this repository as well as the notebooks will not work without them. 

For this project, this was for my MS in Computer Science Course Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning. I hope you guys like it!

If there are any concerns or suggestions, please let me know, I would love them!
